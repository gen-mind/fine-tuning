# Fine-Tuning LLM for a Chatbot ü§ñ

## üéØ Use Case and Goal
This repository focuses on fine-tuning a small language model (LLM) to act as a **chatbot** for [Collaboard](https://www.collaboard.app), an online whiteboard platform. The chatbot will assist users by answering questions on **how Collaboard works**. The goal is to create a model that understands the platform deeply, allowing it to provide accurate and helpful responses. 

## üìö Dataset
We‚Äôve used the full Collaboard manual from the [help.collaboard.app](https://help.collaboard.app) site as the primary dataset for training. This dataset includes comprehensive information about all of Collaboard‚Äôs features.

### ‚ú® Synthetic Data Generation
To enhance memorization and improve the model‚Äôs generalization, **synthetic data** was generated using a process inspired by [fine-tuning for memorization techniques](https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-gpt). This method expands the original dataset by creating **question-answer pairs** from multiple perspectives, helping the model better understand the content and **respond to questions accurately** even when phrased differently. 

## üîß How to Get the Best Results

### üìâ Understanding Loss and Batch Size
A key concept in fine-tuning is **loss**, which measures how far off the model's predictions are from the expected results. To get the best results:

- **Batch Size**: Use a smaller batch size (e.g., 1) for more **granular updates**. Smaller batches are great for **memorization tasks** but may result in overfitting or slower training üê¢. Larger batch sizes, on the other hand, speed things up üöÄ but are less precise for this use case.
  
- **Learning Rate**: Start with a low learning rate (around `1e-4`) and adjust based on the training and validation loss. If the loss jumps around too much, lower the learning rate. If it‚Äôs too smooth, you may have room to increase it slightly.

### ‚è≥ Epochs and Overfitting
Run training for several epochs while monitoring the **validation loss** to avoid overfitting. Overfitting happens when the model performs well on training data but not on unseen data, which we want to avoid. üõë

### üîÑ Data Expansion
To ensure the model generalizes well, we use **data expansion** techniques by generating multiple variations of questions and answers at different temperatures (from `0.0` to `1.2`). This diversity allows the model to handle questions from different angles, resulting in **more accurate answers**.

## üõ† Fine-Tuned Model: OpenChat 3.5
For this project, we fine-tuned the **[OpenChat 3.5](https://huggingface.co/openchat/openchat_3.5)** model. OpenChat is specifically designed for conversational AI, making it a strong candidate for a chatbot use case. The model has approximately **3.5 billion parameters**, and its pre-training focuses on natural, engaging conversations, making it highly adaptable to specific domains like Collaboard.

- **VRAM Requirements**: 
  - **Inference**: ~16 GB
  - **Fine-tuning**: ~24-32 GB

This model‚Äôs lightweight nature and optimization for **dialogue flow** make it a perfect fit for handling user interactions related to Collaboard‚Äôs functionality.

## üõ† Fine-Tuned Components
When it comes to training models, there are two main approaches: Full Training and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) Training.

Full training involves training the entire model, which can be computationally expensive. It typically requires around 8 GPUs with 80GB of VRAM to train the full model using DeepSpeed ZeRO-3.

On the other hand, LoRA or QLoRA fine-tuning is a more resource-efficient approach. It involves training only a small part of the model, which can be done on a single consumer 24GB GPU. In this approach, the lora_target_modules are set as q_proj, k_proj, v_proj, and o_proj 
<p/>
In this fine-tuning process, we used **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** to fine-tune **specific parts of the model**, while freezing the base model's parameters to save memory and training time. The following components were fine-tuned:



- **Attention Layers**: These layers were adapted to help the model focus better on Collaboard-related content.
- **Linear Layers**: These layers were also fine-tuned to improve the model‚Äôs ability to process and memorize the relationships between different pieces of information in the Collaboard dataset.

By focusing on just the attention and linear layers, we optimized the model for **memorization** while maintaining efficiency in training.

## üîÑ Other Possible Models for Chatbot Use
While OpenChat 3.5 was used for this project, there are several other models that are great candidates for chatbot fine-tuning:

- **[GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2)** (OpenAI) - Available in various sizes, up to 1.5B parameters. It‚Äôs lightweight and has good performance after fine-tuning.
- **[DistilGPT-2](https://huggingface.co/distilgpt2)** (Hugging Face) - A smaller and more efficient variant of GPT-2 with faster inference speeds, suitable for quick responses.
- **[GPT-Neo](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B)** (EleutherAI) - An open-source model with a similar architecture to GPT-3. It works well for chatbots and is easy to fine-tune.
- **[Flan-T5](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-base)** (Google) - A fine-tuned version of T5 that‚Äôs been trained to better understand dialogue, making it suitable for conversational use.
- **[Alpaca-7B](https://huggingface.co/chavinlo/alpaca-native)** (Stanford) - A smaller version of LLaMA fine-tuned with instruction-following capabilities, useful for chatbot-type interactions.
- **[LLaMA-7B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b)** (Meta) - Lightweight and efficient for fine-tuning with targeted product-specific data.
- **[BERT-small/mini](https://huggingface.co/google/bert_uncased_L-2_H-128_A-2)** (Hugging Face) - Useful for intent classification and FAQ-style chatbots, capable of handling short, precise responses.
- **[OPT-350M](https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-350m)** (Meta) - An efficient smaller model from Meta, designed for general-purpose conversation and instruction-following tasks.
- **[Mistral-7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B)** (Mistral AI) - A smaller model popular for fine-tuning due to its versatility.
- **[Bloomz-560M](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz-560m)** (BigScience) - A multilingual model that's also efficient and suitable for conversational tasks with moderate datasets.

## üìä Summary
By fine-tuning the **OpenChat 3.5** LLM on **Collaboard-specific data** and using synthetic data, this project aims to create a chatbot that can help users navigate the platform. The key to success lies in balancing memorization and overfitting by carefully managing **loss**, **batch size**, and data preparation, and focusing on **specific layers** during fine-tuning. üí°
