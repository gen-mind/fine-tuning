# **LLM Fine-Tune**

Fine-tuning allows users to adapt pre-trained LLMs to more specialized tasks.

By fine-tuning a model on a small dataset of task-specific data, you can improve its 
performance on that task while preserving its general language knowledge.

Fine-tuning allows you to take a pre-trained **Large Language Model (LLM)** and 
adapt it to your specific needs, improving its understanding and performance within 
specialized domains.

Fine-tuning a model helps customize its performance for a specific domain or task by 
training it on specialized data. This allows the model to excel in understanding and 
generating industry-specific language, concepts, and technical terms, making it more 
useful in specialized fields.

Fine-tuning ensures that your model is not just a generalist but becomes a powerful, 
domain-specific tool, capable of using the correct vocabulary, concepts, and nuances 
critical to your industry.

## üéØÔ∏è **What You Can Achieve with Fine-Tuning**

Fine-tuning a model enables it to:
- [**Improve chatbot accuracy**](https://github.com/gen-mind/fine-tuning/tree/main/usecase-chatbot/readme.md)  by tailoring the assistant to understand and respond with industry-relevant 
language.
- **Understand industry-specific language** (e.g., medical, legal, space, etc.), 
using terminology and concepts unique to your field.
   - It enables the model to adapt to the unique vocabulary and expertise of specific 
  industries, ensuring it provides more accurate and relevant responses tailored to the field.
- **Diagnose technical or mechanical issues**, providing troubleshooting guidance based on 
visual or textual input.
  - **Assess medical conditions** by analyzing symptoms, diagnostic reports, or treatment plans.
  - **Evaluate and estimate car damage**helping with repair cost assessments.
- **Analyze legal documents**, summarizing cases or contracts with accurate legal terminology.
- **Detect patterns in images** 
   - Identify objects or specific features
   - Evaluate product defects or manufacturing inconsistencies based on images
   - Identify damages that requires maintenance assessing priorities (aviation )
   - Identify abnormalities in medical scans
- **Assist in scientific research** by interpreting data from industries like aerospace or engineering.

## üìò **Theory**
For a deeper dive into fine-tuning LLMs, you can explore the detailed concepts in . Below is a brief outline of the key concepts:
<
Fine-tuning builds on the foundation of transfer learning. By adapting a pre-trained LLM to a 
specific domain or task, you achieve higher accuracy and relevance without the need to train 
from scratch. Fine-tuning involves adjusting the model's weights based on a smaller dataset 
that‚Äôs specific to the task, improving domain-specific performance.
Some of the fine-tuning methods are: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reward Modelling: RLHF and DPO

### Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) involves training the model on labeled data, where both the 
inputs and expected outputs are provided. This allows the model to improve on tasks such 
as text classification, named entity recognition, or question answering by learning patterns
and correlations directly from the data.

### Reward Modelling: RLHF and DPO
Reward modeling helps optimize LLMs by rewarding desired behaviors and penalizing incorrect 
or undesired outcomes. Two popular approaches are:
- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**: This technique improves models by 
incorporating human feedback during training, allowing the model to optimize for preferred 
outcomes.
- **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**: DPO also uses human preferences to fine-tune 
the model but focuses on a more direct optimization of user-desired outcomes rather than 
relying solely on trial and error.

### Full Training vs. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) Training
When fine-tuning an LLM, there are two approaches:
- **Full Training**: Involves updating all model parameters, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially for large models.
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: A more efficient method that updates only a smaller subset of model parameters, reducing computational cost and training time. LoRA allows for the fine-tuning of large models with fewer resources by adjusting a smaller, low-rank matrix while keeping the rest of the model frozen.

## üöÄ **Decide which approach to use**
Of course, there isn't a solution that fits it all. It all depends on the specific use case.
