Fine-tuning allows users to adapt pre-trained LLMs to more specialized tasks.

By fine-tuning a model on a small dataset of task-specific data, you can improve its 
performance on that task while preserving its general language knowledge.

Fine-tuning allows you to take a pre-trained **Large Language Model (LLM)** and 
adapt it to your specific needs, improving its understanding and performance within 
specialized domains.

It helps customize its performance for a specific domain or task by 
training it on specialized data. This allows the model to excel in understanding and 
generating industry-specific language, concepts, and technical terms, making it more 
useful in specialized fields.

Fine-tuning ensures that your model is not just a generalist but becomes a powerful, 
domain-specific tool, capable of using the correct vocabulary, concepts, and nuances 
critical to your industry.

If you are interested in dig deeper in the fine-tuning, or if you are unfamiliar 
with this ecosystem [have a look at this document](https://github.com/gen-mind/fine-tuning/tree/main/docs/fine-tune-llm.md)

## üéØÔ∏è **What You Can Achieve with Fine-Tuning**
The goal of this repo is to provide one or more approaches for each use case we mention. Click on the link to 
each specific use case for a detailed deep dive.


For each use case we will try to provide a hands-on sample 


Fine-tuning a model enables it to:
- [**Improve chatbot accuracy**](https://github.com/gen-mind/fine-tuning/tree/main/usecase-chatbot/readme.md)  by tailoring the assistant to understand and respond with industry-relevant 
language.
- **Understand industry-specific language** (e.g., medical, legal, space, etc.), 
using terminology and concepts unique to your field.
   - It enables the model to adapt to the unique vocabulary and expertise of specific 
  industries, ensuring it provides more accurate and relevant responses tailored to the field.
- **Diagnose technical or mechanical issues**, providing troubleshooting guidance based on 
visual or textual input.
  - **Assess medical conditions** by analyzing symptoms, diagnostic reports, or treatment plans.
  - **Evaluate and estimate car damage**helping with repair cost assessments.
- **Analyze legal documents**, summarizing cases or contracts with accurate legal terminology.
- **Detect patterns in images** 
   - Identify objects or specific features
   - Evaluate product defects or manufacturing inconsistencies based on images
   - Identify damages that requires maintenance assessing priorities (aviation )
   - Identify abnormalities in medical scans
- **Assist in scientific research** by interpreting data from industries like aerospace or engineering.
