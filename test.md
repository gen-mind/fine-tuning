Your understanding of fine-tuning is quite solid! Fine-tuning indeed builds on transfer learning by adapting a pre-trained model to a new, domain-specific task, significantly improving performance without the heavy computational cost of training from scratch. Let me expand on your description and provide some useful resources to deepen your understanding.

**Fine-Tuning Overview:**
Fine-tuning leverages the capabilities of a **pre-trained large language model (LLM)** by adjusting its **weights** using a specific, smaller dataset. This process adapts the model from its original broad learning scope to a **narrower, domain-specific task** (e.g., answering customer service questions, legal document analysis). By starting with an already knowledgeable model, you can achieve **better accuracy** and **efficiency** without incurring the cost of training a new model from scratch.
